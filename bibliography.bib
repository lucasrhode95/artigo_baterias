	abstract={Scalability and privacy concerns have created significant interest in decentralized coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) within microgrids. Previously proposed approaches, however, fail to achieve feasible solutions under flexible demand (FD) and energy storage (ES) participation. After justifying and demonstrating this challenge, this paper develops a novel Lagrangian relaxation-based mechanism achieving feasible, near-optimal solutions in a decentralized fashion, considering both active and reactive power. A two-level iterative algorithm eliminates the infeasibility effect of FD and ES nonstrict convexities, and prevents the creation of new demand peaks and troughs by the concentration of their response at the same low- and high-priced periods. Tradeoffs associated with the design and operation of the mechanism are analyzed, and the value of additional information submission by the DER, in enabling the quantification of an optimality bound of the determined solutions and significant improvements in communication requirements, is assessed. These contributions are supported by case studies on an LV microgrid test system.},

	abstract = "A practical semi-empirical battery wear model is proposed for electric vehicle (EV) charging applications. The necessary parameters are investigated for EV charging control from a practical perspective. The proposed battery wear model is based on pervasive experimental cycle life data provided by the manufacturers. The return value of the model directly indicates the wear cost, and thereby, it can be combined with other criteria for multi-objective optimization. As a result, the proposed model is more practically applicable to battery-charging applications than the conventional models. Then, the cost functions are developed for typical vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications incorporating the battery wear. Based on the developed cost functions, several case studies are performed showing the significance of the battery wear. It is shown through simulation that neglecting the effect of wear in V2G applications may lead to an erroneous result attributed to the exaggerated cost."

    abstract = {Electricity generated from renewable sources, which has shown remarkable growth worldwide, can rarely provide immediate response to demand as these sources do not deliver a regular supply easily adjustable to consumption needs. Thus, the growth of this decentralized production means greater network load stability problems and requires energy storage, generally using lead batteries, as a potential solution. However, lead batteries cannot withstand high cycling rates, nor can they store large amounts of energy in a small volume. That is why other types of storage technologies are being developed and implemented. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy from renewable sources, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours when it is more valuable. The work described in this paper highlights the need to store energy in order to strengthen power networks and maintain load levels. There are various types of storage methods, some of which are already in use, while others are still in development. We have taken a look at the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.). These characteristics will serve to make comparisons in order to determine the most appropriate technique for each type of application.}

Pairing Energy Management System (EMS) with PV storage system provides a clean and efficient way to utilize local renewable resources. By dispatching shiftable loads and storage resources, EMS could effectively reshape the electricity net demand profiles and match customer demand and PV generation. In this paper, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework is employed to investigate the peak shaving and valley filling potential of EMS in a HRB which is equipped with PV storage system. The effects of EMS on shiftable loads and PV storage resources are analyzed. The simulation results reveal the feasibility of the proposed approach to effectively flatten the HRB electricity demand and net demand profiles. With the help of EMS, the peak-to-valley ratio of demand profiles and net demand profile are reduced significantly.}

Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the key parameters that affected the costs and benefits of electric vehicle users and power grid companies. The results show that the total net profit of V2G services is greater than zero under the appropriate set of parameters. The net incomes of electric vehicles users are greater than zero in V2G peak shaving services when the peak price of electricity fed into the grid is more than three times the valley price. The lower the cost of electric vehicle battery, the more the net income of single user. The net incomes of power grid companies are always very negative and the higher the peak shaving load, the greater the net loss of the power company. The benefits of power plants are the biggest among three participants and are far greater than those of electric vehicle users. A fair market distribution mechanism of V2G profits should be built among three participants in order to promote the healthy development of V2G applications.}

The method evaluates the optimum performance (including the round trip efficiency and annual discharge), levelised cost (LCOES), the internal rate of return and the levelised value of suitable energy storage technologies. A complimentary methodology was developed including three reference years (2012, 2020 and zero carbon year) to show the evolution of the business case during the low carbon transition. The method follows a community approach and the optimum CES system was calculated as a function of the size of the community. In this work, this method was put in practice with lead-acid (PbA) and lithium-ion battery (Li-ion) technologies when performing PV energy time-shift using real demand data from a single home to a 100-home community. The community approach reduced the LCOES down to 0.30£/kWh and 0.11£/kWh in 2020 and the zero carbon year respectively. These values meant a cost reduction by 37% and 66% regarding a single home. Results demonstrated that PbA batteries needs from 1.5 to 2.5 times more capacity than Li-ion chemistry to reduce the LCOES, the worst case scenario being for the smallest communities, because the more spiky demand profile required proportionately larger PbA battery capacities.}

First, battery energy storage (BES), which is considered as adjustable under worst-case scenarios, is introduced to wind power plants to form a combined wind storage system structure to improve operation flexibility. Then, a dispatching model of CCPPs is presented and analysed. The operating characteristics of CCPPs make it possible to control net power outputs and carbon emissions independently and flexibly. The integration of BES and carbon capture and storage (CCS) improves the operation flexibility of both wind power plants and conventional power plants. The objective function of the proposed model under interval-uncertain wind power is to minimize the total cost under the worst wind power output case and the context of low-carbon economy. The proposed model is implemented on the modified PJM 5-bus system with one wind farm and the IEEE-118 bus system with five wind farms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model is effective at reducing carbon emissions and wind power curtailment, and verify that as the number of CCPPs increases, the overall costs come down.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, lithium ion batteries are increasingly spreading in different areas and therefore, it is very important to understand their aging behavior. According to the technical literature, battery aging can be dissociated in calendar aging and cycle aging. Calendar aging, in particular, depends on the temperature and state of charge (SoC). In addition to the previous factors, cycle aging also depends on the current rate, and charge/discharge cut-off voltages. In the literature, only a few papers have considered battery aging as a function of the charge/discharge current rate, but they agree that a higher current rate leads to faster battery aging. In any case, all of the tests have been conducted in a climactic chamber with a constant room temperature. However, even if the room temperature is controlled, for high current rates, the temperature of the battery cell increases, which makes it impossible to distinguish the aging due to the current from that due to the temperature. For this reason, in the present work, the authors focused on the lithium ion battery aging due to the current rate while maintaining a constant battery temperature using opportunely controlled Peltier cells. In this way, an interesting results was obtained, i.e. the cycle aging is not dependent on the current rate.}
