	abstract={Scalability and privacy concerns have created significant interest in decentralized coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) within microgrids. Previously proposed approaches, however, fail to achieve feasible solutions under flexible demand (FD) and energy storage (ES) participation. After justifying and demonstrating this challenge, this paper develops a novel Lagrangian relaxation-based mechanism achieving feasible, near-optimal solutions in a decentralized fashion, considering both active and reactive power. A two-level iterative algorithm eliminates the infeasibility effect of FD and ES nonstrict convexities, and prevents the creation of new demand peaks and troughs by the concentration of their response at the same low- and high-priced periods. Tradeoffs associated with the design and operation of the mechanism are analyzed, and the value of additional information submission by the DER, in enabling the quantification of an optimality bound of the determined solutions and significant improvements in communication requirements, is assessed. These contributions are supported by case studies on an LV microgrid test system.},

	abstract = "A practical semi-empirical battery wear model is proposed for electric vehicle (EV) charging applications. The necessary parameters are investigated for EV charging control from a practical perspective. The proposed battery wear model is based on pervasive experimental cycle life data provided by the manufacturers. The return value of the model directly indicates the wear cost, and thereby, it can be combined with other criteria for multi-objective optimization. As a result, the proposed model is more practically applicable to battery-charging applications than the conventional models. Then, the cost functions are developed for typical vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications incorporating the battery wear. Based on the developed cost functions, several case studies are performed showing the significance of the battery wear. It is shown through simulation that neglecting the effect of wear in V2G applications may lead to an erroneous result attributed to the exaggerated cost."
